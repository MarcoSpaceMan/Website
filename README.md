Personal Wesbite and HTML/CSS/Javascript Practice


*Marco Website*


The purpose of this is just to learn Javascript, HTML, CSS.  The websit will be made completely from scratch.


Currently the contents of the file are not organized well enough so I'll probably try cleaning it up.


I'm not sure if there are any guidelines on how to organize this type of website.
I want it to be on one webpage (multiple contents) but I'm not sure if I should split up the content into their own files.


Goal is to have a smooth looking website (one of those fancy parallax type ones?)
